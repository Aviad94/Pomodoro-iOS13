# Pomodoro-iOS13
A minimal Pomodoro App which forces you to get the job done!
This application is based on the known technique which is the "Pomodoro Technique". The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
